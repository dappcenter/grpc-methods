v0.6.3 - dannypaz

- Update method signature of grpc-method to take in an AUTH parameter into the requestOptions hash. This changes how authentication is provided to each grpc-method handler

v0.6.2 - dannypaz

- Added authentication to grpc unary/streaming calls to allow the user to check metadata credentials BEFORE a route is submitted. This
allows methods to remove authentication properties and have a single point to check if a user is authorized for the request.
